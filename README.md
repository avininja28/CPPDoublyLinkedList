# CPPDoublyLinkedList

C++ code for creating a doubly linked list.

ALGORITHM:


1. Start

2. Create class node with integer attribute(data) and 2 pointer attributes(eg: head,prev).

3. Using constructor initialize data to 0 and the pointers to null.

4. In main function, use two pointers(head , tail) and indvidual pointers for every new node.

5. Set the data for these new nodes.

6. Set head to first node.

7. Set tail to the last node.

8. Next of each node will point to the successing node.

9. Prev of each node will point to the previous node.

10. Using a pointer and loop , point to each node and display its data , self address , previous address and next address.

11. End.
